## Structural patterns

- They simplify the design of complex systems by creating relationships between objects.
- They help in organizing class hierarchies and allow for easy modification and extension.

**Adapter Pattern**: Design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two objects, converting one interface into another that a client expects.

**Decorator Pattern**: Design pattern used to add new behaviors to objects dynamically—without modifying their original structure. It’s like wrapping a present: each wrapper adds something new without changing the gift itself.

**Proxy Pattern**: Design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It's especially useful when you want to add functionality (like access control, lazy initialization, logging, etc.) without changing the original object's code.
