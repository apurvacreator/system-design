## Creational patterns

- Aims to abstract the instantiation process
- Makes systems more flexible, maintainable, and scalable by decoupling the client code from the concrete classes it needs to instantiate.

**Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It's a creational design pattern commonly used to manage shared resources like configuration, logging, or connection pools.

**Factory Pattern**: Design pattern that provides a way to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. Instead of using new directly, you use a factory method to get instances, often based on input or conditions.

**Abstract Factory Pattern**: Design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Itâ€™s like a factory of factories, giving you a flexible way to create groups of objects that work well together.
