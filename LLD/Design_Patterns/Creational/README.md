## Creational patterns

- Aims to abstract the instantiation process
- Makes systems more flexible, maintainable, and scalable by decoupling the client code from the concrete classes it needs to instantiate.

**Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It's a creational design pattern commonly used to manage shared resources like configuration, logging, or connection pools.
