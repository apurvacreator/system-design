- Association: Relationship between two classes. Ex: Teacher and Student. Both can exist independently.
- Aggregation - A weak, **_has-a_** relationship between two classes. Ex: Department has professors. However, Professors can exist without a Department.
- Composition - A strong, **_has-a_** relationship between two classes. Contained objects get destroyed when the container class is destroyed. Ex: House has a room.
- Generalization - **is-a** relationship aka inheritance.
- Dependency - One class uses another class temporarily (Similar to Dependency Injection).
- Realization - A relationship between a class and an interface that implements it.
