## Open Closed Principle

### Software components should be closed for modification, but open for extension.

**Closed for modification** - To add new features to a software component, exisiting code need not have to be modified.

**Open for extension** - A software component should be extendible to add new feature or behavior to it.

**_Open closed principle works in tandem with the Single responsibility principle_**
